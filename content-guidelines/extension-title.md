# Extension Name

Your extension’s name is critical. It shows up everywhere—in search results, on [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org 'addons.mozilla.org'), and in the browser itself. It’s sometimes one of the few pieces of information that a user has to determine whether or not they are interested in what you built.

Research shows that people really do take an extension’s name into account when making installation decisions. And, what you put into extension name field becomes your URL on [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org 'addons.mozilla.org').

Between your name and subtitle, you have up to 70 characters to use—that’s because 70 is the max character limit for your headline in external search results. It’s best to keep your name shorter so you have more characters left over for your subtitle.

## Extension Name Do’s and Don’ts

<!-- Do this -->
<section class="do-this" markdown="1"><header><h5>Do This:</h5></header>

- Make it memorable
- Make it unique
- Keep it short for better display on smaller screens
- Make it easy to read and say
- Give an idea or hint about what your extension does with an illustrative word or metaphor

<!-- Example (Block) -->

**Examples:**

<div class="example" markdown="1">

An extension that saves passwords is called **Remembear**

An extension that puts a cat on new tabs is called **Tabbycat**

An extension that improves YouTube is called **Enhancer for YouTube**

</div>
<!-- END: Example (Block) -->
</section>
<!-- END: Do this -->

<!-- Not this -->
<section class="not-this" markdown="1"><header><h5>Not This:</h5></header>

##### 1. Don't include a description.

Save these details for your subtitle and description.

<!-- Example (Inline) -->

<span class="example">Example: Videomix, a fast video downloader extension</span>

<!-- END: Example (Inline) -->

##### 2. Don't stuff it with keywords.

Google is smarter than this and it just makes your extension look untrustworthy.

<!-- Example (Inline) -->

<span class="example">Example: Youtube Download Videos, Convert, Media, MP3, MP4, Free.</span>

<!-- END: Example (Inline) -->

##### 3. Don't use random words to differentiate, like “Barbara Notetaker.”

Instead, create a descriptive name that is not already in use, like “Instant Notetaker.”

##### 4. Don't call it something with no meaning, like “hoyv.”

While the name “hoyv” doesn’t work, the name “uBlock Origin” for an ad-blocking extension does because it contains the word “block”.

##### 5. Don't include "WebExtension," “Firefox”, or “Mozilla."

##### 6. Don't include version number or a previous name.

<!-- Example (Inline) -->

<span class="example">Example: Weatherchanger (fix version)</span>

<!-- END: Example (Inline) -->

##### 7. Don't make it hard to read or say.

<!-- Example (Inline) -->

<span class="example">Example: TrLrs! Tab Changer.</span>

<!-- END: Example (Inline) -->

<section class="tile" markdown="1">

#### Requirements

- Minimum length: 2 characters
- Maximum length: 70 characters between extension name and subtitle

</section>
<!-- END: Tile -->

## Stuck? Try this.

#### 1. Identify the problem

What problem does your extension solve? Why did you create this extension? Write that down.

Let’s take the popular extension, Remembear, as an example. You can imagine the creator of this extension writing something like this: "I am tired of having to remember all of my passwords for the web. And I worry that these passwords will get stolen. I want a simple way to save and secure my passwords so they are always at my fingertips. And I don’t want the experience to be an unpleasant, security-laden process. Let’s make it friendly and easy."

#### 2. Identify key words

Pull out the key words (nouns, adjectives, verbs) and phrases from your problem statement and create a word list. Add other words that come to mind based on those words, including synonyms.

Remembear Example:

- Tired
- Remember
- Passwords
- Worry
- Stolen
- Simple
- Save
- Secure
- At your fingertips
- Friendly
- Easy

#### 3. Consider a metaphor

**Consider adding a person, place, or thing that summarizes or serves as a metaphor for what your extension does.**

Remembear example: Saving and protecting passwords is not very unique from what other extensions do, so finding a good metaphor might help create a unique name. What animal, place, or thing makes me think about safety and security? How about a mother bear? Mother bears are notorious for protecting their young.

#### 4. Create combinations

Take that list of words and try different combinations until you land on something that feels right.

Remembear example:

- Protect passwords with mother bear    
_Motherbear_

- Remember passwords with mother bear  
_Protect passwords with a bear_

- Remember password with a bear  
_Remembear_
