## Stay informed when Firefox changes

We’re constantly improving Firefox and the add-on experience. Use [this list of resources for publishers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/Distribution/Resources_for_publishers) to stay up-to-date with Firefox news and developments.

## Promote your extension

Keep your user base growing regularly reviewing your listing to [make sure it’s as appealing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/Listing) as it can be.

However you choose to distribute your extension, you’ll want to promote your extension or theme.

Mozilla promotes a selection of [Recommended Extensions](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2019/04/08/recommended-extensions-program-coming-soon/) that meet a high standard of security, utility, and user experience. If you’d like your extension to be included in the program, submit a nomination.

[Making money from browser extensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/Distribution/Make_money_from_browser_extensions) is also something you might want to consider as your user base grows.

## Publish extension updates

When you’re ready to improve your extension or receive suggestions for new features from your user community, you might decide to publish an update.

[Best practices for updating extensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Best_practices_for_updating_your_extension)

## Manage authors of your extension

Add-ons are often the result of the work of a team of developers, which is why [add-ons on AMO can have multiple authors](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nw5FMHI4pH3iKHEdLS6GuAUl9oRfFd5P4uC7wEAQaCU/edit#heading=h.w6vo7guwwexf).

If someone is using your code without your permission, please follow [these instructions](https://www.mozilla.org/about/legal/report-infringement/) to file a DMCA Notice with Mozilla’s legal team to resolve the situation.

## Removing your extension from distribution

Sometimes, add-ons outlive their usefulness: features they provide may be added to Firefox, your product or service may evolve, or it could simply be easier to write a new extension than maintain your old one.

Here’s how to [Retire your extension](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/Distribution/Retiring_your_extension) gracefully.

{% endcapture %}
{% include modules/one-column.html
	id="removing-your-extension-from-distribution"
