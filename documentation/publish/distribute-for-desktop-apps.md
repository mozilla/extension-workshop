If you have developed an add-on to complement a desktop application, there are several ways you can install the add-on:

- Direct the user to install from [addons.mozilla.org (AMO)](https://addons.mozilla.org) by offering a link.
- Sideloading.
- Using the Windows registry.

Of these options, directing the user to install from AMO by offering a link is recommended. The reasons for recommending this option are:

- It avoids any issues with the installation process; the user will not get an interstitial messages during the installation of the add-on, find the add-on installed but disabled, or find that the add-on was not installed.
- If you update the add-on, the new version will be automatically installed, once you have uploaded it to AMO.

By contrast, sideloading using the [standard extension folders](/documentation/publish/distribute-sideloading/#standard-extension-folders) or [Windows registry](/documentation/enterprise/enterprise-distribution/#installation-using-windows-registry) will require your desktop app to install any update to the add-on. Also, based on the default Firefox settings, the installation process will present the user with warnings (an interstitial message) or silently install the add-on but disable it. The worst case is that the installation will fail silently if [Firefox is setup to disable automatic installation](/documentation/enterprise/enterprise-distribution/#firefox-settings). You can update the [Firefox configuration](/documentation/enterprise/enterprise-distribution/#firefox-settings) to avoid these issues, but that is not recommended.
