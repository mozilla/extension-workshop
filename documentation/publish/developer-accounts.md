# Developer accounts

Developer accounts for addons.mozilla.org are integrated with [Firefox Accounts](https://accounts.firefox.com/signup), which lets you access and manage multiple Mozilla services from one account. You can manage your Firefox Account from [accounts.firefox.com/settings](https://accounts.firefox.com/settings).

## Setting a display name

Itâ€™s important to set a display name on your profile on [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org) to increase transparency with users, add-on reviewers, and the greater community.

{% capture note %}

Your Firefox Account display name will not sync to your profile on addons.mozilla.org. You will need to set your developer account display name from your profile on addons.mozilla.org.

## Blocked accounts

To mitigate malicious actors from submitting spam to addons.mozilla.org, we will not accept submissions from accounts that use a disposable temporary email address, or that have submitted multiple add-ons that violate our [Add-on Policies](/documentation/publish/add-on-policies).

If you believe your account has been incorrectly blocked, please email amo-admins [at] mozilla [dot] com and include a link to your developer profile.
