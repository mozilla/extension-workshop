# Extension Subtitle

The subtitle is one of your extension’s most important pieces of content. It’s the thing that shows up in search results, drawing a potential user’s attention. It makes your extension more discoverable. And, it’s used everywhere—in search results, throughout [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org 'addons.mozilla.org'), and in the Firefox browser.

**A subtitle is a short phrase that clearly, concisely explains what your extension does.** It’s short for a reason: extension name + subtitle become your headline on search. While the name may appear by itself in some contexts, the subtitle will never appear without the name.

## Extension Subtitle Do’s and Don’ts

<section class="do-this" markdown="1"><header><h5>Do This:</h5></header>

- Keep it short: You have 70 characters to use between extension name and extension subtitle. It may be best to keep your extension name shorter, so you have more room in your subtitle. Don’t worry, you also have an unlimited description field to provide a longer, detailed explanation of your product.
- Capture the key features of your extension.
- Make it accurate—our reviewers will check to make sure it reflects your extension’s functionality.
- Be direct and to-the-point. The goal is to be informative, not overly market your product.
- If writing in English, use sentence case rather than title case. It’s easier to read.
- If you have the room, end your subtitle with closing punctuation (like a period or exclamation mark), especially if written as a phrase or short sentence.
- Only say your extension is “free” if this distinguishes it from other extensions like it—most extensions are free. If you are a VPN extension, however, it may make sense to include the word “free” in your subtitle since VPNs are not often free.
- Incorporate keywords that someone might use to search for your extension. But keep it natural—forcing keywords won’t improve search rankings or compel potential users.

To determine your keywords, think about what words a person would use when searching for an extension like yours. Consider the problem that user is trying to solve. For example, what words would someone use when searching for a proofreader or ad-blocking extension?

##### 1. Don’t overpromise.

If you have in fact created the fastest proxy on the planet, you should say that. If it isn’t faster than its competitors, focus on other descriptors and features to distinguish it.

##### 2. Don’t use filler, redundant words like “this extension”.

<span class="example">Example: Video Organizer extension that downloads and organizes media.</span>

##### 3. Don’t add formatting like bullets or line breaks.

This will take up your limited real estate.
