# Extensions and the add-on ID

Firefox add-ons contain a unique ID that is used to distinguish one add-on from any other Firefox add-on.

Firefox uses an extension's unique ID inside Firefox and on the [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/) (AMO) website. For example, it's used by Firefox to check for updates to installed add-ons and to identify which objects (such as data stores) are controlled by the add-on.

This article describes how add-on IDs are handled for extensions built with WebExtensions APIs.

## When do I need an add-on ID?

All [Manifest V3 extensions](/documentation/develop/manifest-v3-migration-guide/) need an add-on ID in their manifest.json when submitted to AMO.

For Manifest V2 extensions, you need to add an add-on ID when:

- You want to install an unsigned add-on from its XPI file, rather than loading it temporarily using `about:debugging`.
- You want a specific ID, rather than one randomly generated when [your extension is first signed](/documentation/publish/#get-your-extension-signed).
- You use [AMO's API](https://addons-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/api/v4_frozen/signing.html) for uploading your add-on, rather than uploading it manually on its page, you must include the add-on's ID in the request.
- You use WebExtension APIs that use the add-on ID and expect it to be the same from one browser session to the next. If you use these APIs, you must explicitly set the ID using the [`browser_specific_settings`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/browser_specific_settings) key. This applies to the following APIs:
  - [`storage.managed`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/storage/managed "A storage.StorageArea object that represents the managed storage area. Items in managed storage are set by the domain administrator or other native applications installed on user's computer, and are read-only for the extension. Trying to modify this storage area results in an error.")
  - [`storage.sync`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/storage/sync 'Represents the sync storage area. Items in sync storage are synced by the browser, and are available across all instances of that browser that the user is logged into (e.g. via Firefox sync, or a Google account), across different devices.')
  - [`identity.getRedirectURL`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/identity/getRedirectURL 'Generates a URL that you can use as a redirect URL.')
  - [Native messaging](https://developer.mozilla.org/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_messaging)
  - [`pkcs11`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/pkcs11 'The pkcs11 API enables an extension to enumerate PKCS #11 security modules and to make them accessible to the browser as sources of keys and certificates.')
  - [`runtime.onMessageExternal`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/runtime/onMessageExternal "This API can't be used in a content script.")
  - [`runtime.onConnectExternal`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/runtime/onConnectExternal 'Fired when an extension receives a connection request from a different extension.')
- You use the [`dictionaries` key in manifest.json](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/dictionaries).

Otherwise, for Manifest V2 extensions, AMO adds an add-on ID during the signing process.

## How do I set an add-on ID?

See [`browser_specific_settings` in manifest.json](https://developer.mozilla.org/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/browser_specific_settings) for the syntax of setting the extension ID.

## Basic workflow with no add-on ID (Manifest V2)

An add-on ID is usually optional for Manifest V2 extensions. If you don't set it, you can generally develop, debug, publish, and update your extension without ever having to deal with an ID. One advantage of this is that Google Chrome does not recognize the `browser_specific_settings` key and shows a warning if you include it.

However, there are some implications of not setting an add-on ID that are described in this section.

### Developing and debugging

If your manifest.json does not contain an ID, the extension is assigned a randomly-generated temporary ID when you [install it in Firefox](/documentation/develop/temporary-installation-in-firefox/) through `about:debugging`. If you then reload the extension using the "Reload" button, the same ID is used. If you restart Firefox and load the add-on again, it gets a new ID.

If you turn the extension into an `.xpi` or `.zip` and install it through `about:addons`, it will not work. For it to work, you must add the [`browser_specific_settings`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/browser_specific_settings) key in `manifest.json`.

### Publishing

Once you have finished developing the extension, you can [package it and submit it to AMO for review and signing](/documentation/publish/signing-and-distribution-overview/). If the packaged extension you upload does not contain an ID, AMO generates one. It's only at this point that the add-on is assigned a permanent ID, which is embedded in the signed packaged extension.

### Updating

After publication, you don't generally have to deal with the ID. You can continue to develop the add-on without an ID, and when you want to update, upload the new version by visiting the add-on's AMO page. Because you are uploading the add-on through that page, AMO knows that this is an update to the add-on, even though it doesn't contain an ID.

::: note
With this workflow, you must update the add-on _manually using its page on AMO_. Otherwise, AMO does not understand that the submission is an update to an existing add-on and treats the update as a new add-on.
