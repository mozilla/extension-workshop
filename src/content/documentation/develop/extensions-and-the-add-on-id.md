# Extensions and the add-on ID

Firefox add-ons are distinguished by a unique ID. These unique IDs are used inside Firefox and on the [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/) (AMO) website. For example, they are used by Firefox to check for updates to installed add-ons and to identify which objects (such as data stores) are controlled by the add-on.

This article describes how add-on IDs are handled for extensions built with WebExtensions APIs.

## When do I need an add-on ID?

### Signing and publishing

All signed add-ons have a unique ID. It's recommended that you define an extension ID and add it to your extension's manifest.json file when you begin development.

For [Manifest V3 extensions](/documentation/develop/manifest-v3-migration-guide/) you must add an ID to your extension's manifest.json file before it's submitted to AMO ([online](/documentation/publish/submitting-an-add-on/) or using [`web-ext sign`](/documentation/develop/web-ext-command-reference/#web-ext-sign) or the [AMO API create endpoint](https://mozilla.github.io/addons-server/topics/api/addons.html#create)).

If you don't add an ID to a Manifest V2 extension before submission, AMO assigns your extension an ID when you submit it to AMO (online or using `web-ext sign` or the AMO API create endpoint).

When you submit an add-on to AMO with an ID defined, AMO checks that the ID is unique.

### Development and testing

You need to set an ID in your extensions manifest.json file when:

- You want to install an unsigned add-on from its XPI file, rather than loading it temporarily using `about:debugging`.
- You use these WebExtension APIs that rely on the add-on ID and expect it to be the same from one browser session to the next:
  - [`storage.managed`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/storage/managed "A storage.StorageArea object that represents the managed storage area. Items in managed storage are set by the domain administrator or other native applications installed on the user's computer and are read-only for the extension. Trying to modify this storage area results in an error.")
  - [`storage.sync`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/storage/sync 'Represents the sync storage area. Items in sync storage are synced by the browser and are available across all instances of that browser that the user is logged into (e.g. using Firefox sync, or a Google account), across different devices.')
  - [`identity.getRedirectURL`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/identity/getRedirectURL 'Generates a URL that you can use as a redirect URL.')
  - [Native messaging](https://developer.mozilla.org/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_messaging)
  - [`pkcs11`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/pkcs11 'The pkcs11 API enables an extension to enumerate PKCS #11 security modules and to make them accessible to the browser as sources of keys and certificates.')
  - [`runtime.onMessageExternal`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/runtime/onMessageExternal "This API can't be used in a content script.")
  - [`runtime.onConnectExternal`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/runtime/onConnectExternal 'Fired when an extension receives a connection request from a different extension.')
- You use the [`dictionaries` key in manifest.json](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/dictionaries).

## How do I set an add-on ID?

See [`browser_specific_settings` in manifest.json](https://developer.mozilla.org/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/browser_specific_settings) for the syntax of setting the extension ID.

## Working without an ID in Manifiest V2

An add-on ID is optional for Manifest V2 extensions. If you don't set it, you can generally develop, debug, publish, and update your extension without ever having to deal with an ID. One advantage of this is that Google Chrome does not recognize the `browser_specific_settings` key and shows a warning if you include it.

However, there are some implications of not setting an add-on ID that are described in this section.

### Developing and debugging

If your manifest.json does not contain an ID, the extension is assigned a randomly-generated temporary ID when you [install it in Firefox](/documentation/develop/temporary-installation-in-firefox/) through `about:debugging`. If you then reload the extension using the "Reload" button, the same ID is used. If you restart Firefox and load the add-on again, it gets a new ID. This affects the APIs listed in [Development and testing](#development-and-testing].

If you turn the extension into an `.xpi` or `.zip` and install it through `about:addons`, it does not work. For it to work, you must add the [`browser_specific_settings`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/browser_specific_settings) key in `manifest.json`.

### Publishing

When you have finished developing the extension, you can [package it and submit it to AMO for review and signing](/documentation/publish/signing-and-distribution-overview/). If the packaged extension you upload does not contain an ID, AMO generates one. It's only at this point that the add-on is assigned a permanent ID, which is embedded in the signed packaged extension.

### Updating

After publication, you don't generally have to deal with the ID. You can continue to develop the add-on without an ID, and when you want to update, upload the new version by visiting the add-on's AMO page. Because you are uploading the add-on through that page, AMO knows that this is an update to the add-on, even though it doesn't contain an ID.

However, if you use [AMO's API](https://addons-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/api/v4_frozen/signing.html) to upload an update to a Manifiest V2 extension that doesn't define the ID in its manifest.json file you must include the add-on's ID in the request.
