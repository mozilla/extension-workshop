# Debugging

This article explains how to use the Firefox developer tools to debug extensions.

An extension can consist of several components—background scripts, popups, options pages, content scripts, sidebars, and alike—and you'll use slightly different workflows to debug each component. Each component has a section in this article, and you can read each section in isolation. We'll begin by introducing the developer tools, which you'll use to debug all the pieces of your extension.

## Developer tools toolbox

You use an implementation of the developer tools called Toolbox to debug extensions. To open Toolbox for an extension:

- enter `about:debugging` in the URL bar.
- in the left-hand menu, click **This Firefox** (or **This Nightly**).
- click **Inspect** next to your extension.

A new tab opens showing **Inspector** in the Toolbox.

![developers tool screenshot](/assets/img/documentation/develop/developing_tools_inspector.png)

To debug your extension, you'll use:

- [**Inspector**](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector) to examine and modify the HTML and CSS used to build your extension's pages.
- [**Console**](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/Web_Console) to view messages logged by the extension and error messages logged by the browser as it runs the extension. It also provides a command line, where you can execute JavaScript in the extension's context.
- [**Debugger**](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/Debugger) to set breakpoints and watchpoints in your extension's JavaScript, and examine and modify the extension's state.
- [**Storage**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Storage_Inspector) to view details of data stored by the extension.

For much of the debugging work, it's useful to be able to view **Console** with **Inspector** or **Debugger**. You do this using the [split console](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/Web_Console/Split_console), press `esc` to activate this mode.

![developers tool split screenshot](/assets/img/documentation/develop/developing_tools_inspector_split.png)

You can now drag the toolbox tab to a separate window, so you can place it alongside the window where you're executing the extension.

## Debugging background scripts

::: note
We use the [notify-link-clicks-i18n](https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples/tree/master/notify-link-clicks-i18n) extension example to illustrate the debugging features relevant to background scripts. This example is in the [webextensions-examples](https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples) repository.
:::

<!-- Single Column Body Module -->
[Background scripts](https://developer.mozilla.org/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Anatomy_of_a_WebExtension#Background_scripts) enable an extension to maintain a long-term state or perform long-term operations, independently of any web page or browser window. These scripts remain loaded for the lifetime of the extension. Background scripts are loaded inside an invisible background page: by default, this is an empty HTML document, but you can specify a custom page and define it as the background page using the `manifest.json` [`background`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/background) key.

To debug background scripts, use the [Toolbox](#developer-tools-toolbox) **Debugger** in the [split console](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/Web_Console/Split_console) view so you can view the **Console** below **Debugger**.

To get started, open your background script in **Sources**.

![background script screenshot](/assets/img/documentation/develop/locate_background_script.png)

As you run your extension, the **Console** displays logged output, including calls to [`console.log()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Console/log) made by the extension's background scripts and any errors the browser raises as it executes these scripts. Note that the console shows all errors raised by the browser, not just errors related to your extension's code.

For example, the [notify-link-clicks-i18n](https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples/tree/master/notify-link-clicks-i18n) example extension logs a message from its background script when it receives a message from one of its content scripts.

![background script console log screenshot](/assets/img/documentation/develop/background_script_console_log.png)

Using the **Console** command line, you can access and modify the objects created by your background scripts. For example, you can call the `notify()` function:

![execute from console screenshot](/assets/img/documentation/develop/execute_from_console.png)

In the **Debugger** you can set breakpoints, step through code, modify the extension's state, and do [everything else you'd expect to be able to do in a debugger](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/Debugger).

![add breakpoint screenshot](/assets/img/documentation/develop/adding_breakpoint.png)

For more information about using the debugger, see the [Debugger](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/Debugger) guide.

## Debugging options pages

::: note
We use the [favourite-colour](https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples/tree/master/favourite-colour) extension example to illustrate the debugging features relevant to options pages. This example is in the [webextensions-examples](https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples) repository.
:::

An [options pages](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/user_interface/Options_pages) is an HTML page shown when the user accesses your extension's preferences in Add-ons Manager, either by opening Add-ons Manager themselves or using a link provided in your extension. You use an options page to enable the user to set and save options and settings that affect the behavior of your extension. Options pages display in an iframe in Add-ons Manager.

To debug options pages, use the [Toolbox](#developer-tools-toolbox) **Debugger** in the [split console](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/Web_Console/Split_console) view so you can view the **Console** below **Debugger**.

To get started:

- enter `about:addons` in the URL bar, to open Add-ons Manager.
- open your extension's preferences:

![open preferences screenshot](/assets/img/documentation/develop/open_preferences.png)

- locate the options page script in Sources.

![open scripts in debugger screenshot](/assets/img/documentation/develop/options_script_in_debugger.png)

In the **Debugger** you can set breakpoints, step through code, modify the extension's state, and do [everything else you'd expect to be able to do in a debugger](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/Debugger). Any messages logged by your code display in **Console**.

To debug the options page's HTML and CSS, point the tools at the iframe that hosts the page. To do this:

- switch to **Inspector**.
- click the page selector (1).
- click the options page's HTML item (2).

![open options page HTML screenshot](/assets/img/documentation/develop/open_options_page_HTML.png)

For more information about using **Inspector**, see the [Inspector](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector) guide.

## Debugging popups

::: note
We use the [beastify](https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples/tree/master/beastify) extension example to illustrate the debugging features relevant to popups. This example is in the [webextensions-examples](https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples) repository.
:::

[Popups](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Popups) are dialogs attached to browser or page actions. Popups are specified using an HTML document that can include CSS and JavaScript, which define styling and behavior.

To debug popups, use the [Toolbox](#developer-tools-toolbox) **Debugger** in the [split console](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/Web_Console/Split_console) view so you can view the **Console** below **Debugger**.

To debug a popup it needs to be visible (so that its HTML document is loaded). However, having opened a popup, if you click outside the popup it closes and its code unloads. This would appear to make debugging rather difficult. To overcome this challenge, in the options menu, click **Disable Popup Auto-Hide**.

![disable popup auto-hide screenshot](/assets/img/documentation/develop/disable_popup_auto_hide.png)

Now, when you open a popup it stays open and its code remains loaded.

::: note
Disable popup auto-hide also applies to built-in browser popups, such as the options menu. The setting doesn't persist across sessions. When you close the window, the setting reverts to auto-hide popups.

Internally, this option toggles the `ui.popup.disable_autohide` preference, which you can toggle manually from `about:config`.
:::

With the popup open, its JavaScript sources are listed in **Debugger**. In the **Debugger** you can set breakpoints, step through code, modify the extension's state, and do [everything else you'd expect to be able to do in a debugger](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/Debugger). Any messages logged by your code display in **Console**.

![popup in debugger screenshot](/assets/img/documentation/develop/popup_in_debugger.png)

To inspect the popup's HTML and CSS, use **Inspector** in the [split console](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/Web_Console/Split_console) view so you can view the **Console** below **Inspector**. You can [review and modify the popup's HTML and CSS in **Inspector**](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector), as you would with any webpage.

![popup in inspector screenshot](/assets/img/documentation/develop/popup_in_inspector.png)

If your extension has multiple HTML documents open, click the page select icon (![pages selector](/assets/img/documentation/develop/page-selector.png)) to open the popup's document.

## Debugging content scripts

::: note
We use the [notify-link-clicks-i18n](https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples/tree/master/notify-link-clicks-i18n) extension example to illustrate the debugging features relevant to content scripts. This example is in the [webextensions-examples](https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples) repository.
:::

A [content script](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Content_scripts) is a part of your extension that runs in the context of a webpage; it enables your extension to react to events on the webpage and make changes to a webpage's content.

Because [Firefox is multiprocess](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Multiprocess_Firefox), content scripts run in a different process to other parts of an extension. Therefore, to debug content scripts, you use the developer tools for the page containing the script. To do this:

- in the Firefox menu (or **Tools** menu if you display the menu bar or are on macOS), click **Web Developer** then **Debugger**.
- press `Ctrl + Shift + i` (`Command + Option + i` on macOS) and click **Debugger**.

If you've already activated the [split console](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/Web_Console/Split_console) view, so you can view the **Console** below **Debugger**, the tools open in this mode. Otherwise, press `esc` to activate this mode.

![content script in debug](/assets/img/documentation/develop/content_script_in_debug.png)

Select your content scripts listed in **Sources**. You can set breakpoints, step through code, modify the extension's state, and do [everything else you'd expect to be able to do in a debugger](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/Debugger). Any messages logged by your code display in **Console**.

::: note
If the developer tools tab was not open when the content script injected, the content script may not be list in **Sources**. If you experience this behavior, reloading the page with the developer tools open should provide a fix.

## Debugging sidebars

::: note
We use the [annotate-page](https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples/tree/master/annotate-page) extension example to illustrate the debugging features relevant to sidebars. This example is in the [webextensions-examples](https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples) repository.
:::

A [Sidebar](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/user_interface/Sidebars) is a pane displayed at the side of the browser window, next to the web page. Sidebars are specified using an HTML document that can include CSS and JavaScript, which define styling and behavior.

To debug a sidebar, use the [Toolbox](#developer-tools-toolbox) **Debugger** in the [split console](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/Web_Console/Split_console) view so you can view the **Console** below **Debugger**.

To debug a sidebar, open the sidebar and locate its JavaScript in **Debugger**.

![sidebar script in debugger](/assets/img/documentation/develop/sidebar_script_in_debugger.png)

In the **Debugger** you can set breakpoints, step through code, modify the extension's state, and do [everything else you'd expect to be able to do in a debugger](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/Debugger). Any messages logged by your code display in **Console**.

To inspect the sidebar's HTML and CSS, use **Inspector** in the [split console](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/Web_Console/Split_console) view so you can view the **Console** below **Inspector**. You can [review and modify the sidebar's HTML and CSS in **Inspector**](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector), as you would with any webpage.

![sidebar script in debugger](/assets/img/documentation/develop/sidebar_page_in_inspector.png)

If your extension has multiple HTML documents open, click the page select icon (![pages selector](/assets/img/documentation/develop/page-selector.png)) to open the sidebar's document.

## Debugging storage

::: note
We use the [annotate-page](https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples/tree/master/annotate-page) extension example to illustrate the debugging features relevant to extension storage. This example is in the [webextensions-examples](https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples) repository.
:::

An extension can store data using the [Storage API](https://wiki.developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/storage). To view this data, in the [Toolbox](#developer-tools-toolbox) open the **Storage** tab and locate **Extension Storage**.

![sidebar script in debugger](/assets/img/documentation/develop/sidebar_data_in_storage.png)

## Debugging developer tools pages and panels

::: note
We use the [devtools-panels](https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples/tree/master/devtools-panels) extension example to illustrate the debugging features relevant to developer tools pages and panels. This example is in the [webextensions-examples](https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples) repository.
:::

[Developer tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Extending_the_developer_tools) are extended with a hidden HTML page that is loaded when the tools are opened. From the hidden HTML page, [developer tools panels](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/devtools.panels/create) can be added; these are HTML pages displayed as a tool tab in the browser UI.

To debug development tools pages and panels, use the [Toolbox](#developer-tools-toolbox) **Debugger** in the [split console](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/Web_Console/Split_console) view so you can view the **Console** below **Debugger**.

To debug additions to the developer tools, open the developer tools and any custom panels, and locate their JavaScript in **Debugger**.

![developer tools in debugger](/assets/img/documentation/develop/developer_tools_in_debugger.png)

In the **Debugger** you can set breakpoints, step through code, modify the extension's state, and do [everything else you'd expect to be able to do in a debugger](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/Debugger). Any messages logged by your code display in **Console**.

To debug the custom developer tools pages' HTML and CSS:

- switch to **Inspector**.
- click the page selector (1).
- click the custom development tools page item you want to inspect (2).

![developer tools selecting page in inspector](/assets/img/documentation/develop/developer_tools_selecting_page_in_inspector.png)

You can [review and modify the custom development tools page HTML and CSS in **Inspector**](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector), as you would with any webpage.
