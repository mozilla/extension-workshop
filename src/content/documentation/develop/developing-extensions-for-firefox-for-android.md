You approach the coding of an extension for Firefox for Android in the same way as you would for a desktop extension; using a text editor or tool of your choice to write the code. However, when you want to test and debug your extension you need to follow a different process, this article walks you through that process.

## Set up your computer and Android emulator or device

Complete some one-off setup tasks on your computer and Android device.

On your development computer:

- Install or update [web-ext](https://github.com/mozilla/web-ext) to version 4.1.0 or later.
- Use the Android Studio [SDK Manager](https://developer.android.com/studio/intro/update.html#sdk-manager) or the [sdkmanager](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/sdkmanager.html) command-line tool to install the [Android Platform Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools.html)
- Make sure you have adb installed ([Linux](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-linux.zip), [Mac](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-darwin.zip), [Windows](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-windows.zip)) and in your `PATH`.

On your device or Android emulator:

- Install [Firefox for Android Nightly](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.fenix)
- [Enable Android USB debugging on the device](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options).
- Attach your device to the development computer using a USB cable. When prompted, allow USB debugging for the connection.
- In the settings view for Firefox for Android Nightly, enable "Remote debugging via USB."

Then, on your development computer:

- Open a command shell.
- Run `adb devices`
  You should see output similar to:
  ``` shell
  List of devices attached
  51800F220F01564 device
  ```
  Where the hex string is your device’s (or emulator’s) code. This means adb has found your device (or emulator).

## Check for Firefox for Android compatibility

### Lint with web-ext 

Before running your extension on Firefox for Android, consider using [`web-ext lint`](/documentation/develop/web-ext-command-reference#web-ext-lint). Lint performs a check to determine if any of the permissions, manifest keys, and web extension APIs you're using are incompatible with Firefox for Android. Lint relies on your extension's manifest.json file including `strict_min_version` values for the optional `gecko` and `gecko_android` sub-keys in [`browser_specific_settings`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/browser_specific_settings). It then reports on the features that are not supported by the minimum version you have set.

In the lint report:

- incompatible permissions are identified by `PERMISSION_FIREFOX_ANDROID_UNSUPPORTED_BY_MIN_VERSION`,
- incompatible manifest keys are identified by `KEY_FIREFOX_ANDROID_UNSUPPORTED_BY_MIN_VERSION`, and
- incompatible APIs are identified by `ANDROID_INCOMPATIBLE_API`

similar to this:

![linter screenshot](/assets/img/documentation/develop/linter_output2.png)

::: note alert
Lint does not report on APIs that are not implemented by Firefox or Firefox for Android.
:::

When setting `strict_min_version` values in `browser_specific_settings`, unless you're targeting a specific version of Firefox, choose the most recent version of Firefox you expect your extension to be compatible with. Due to Android's different APIs and form factors (compared to desktop Firefox), set `gecko_android` after explicitly verifying compatibility. This sub-key enables a compatibility range that is distinct from Firefox for desktop.

```json
"browser_specific_settings": {
  "gecko": {
    "strict_min_version": "102.0"
  },
  "gecko_android": {
    "strict_min_version": "113.0"
  }
}
```

### Android API and UX checklist

Before making your extension available, test it on Android to ensure it works as expected. When you publish it on AMO, reviewers may reject it or request changes if it doesn't meet basic usability requirements.

- If you haven't used `web-ext lint`, check [Browser Support for JavaScript APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Browser_support_for_JavaScript_APIs) to verify that the APIs your extension uses are available on Firefox for Android.

- Make sure HTML pages have [viewport meta tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Viewport_meta_tag#viewport_basics) to scale your extension's UI on mobile screens properly.

- Use [responsive design patterns](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design) to ensure that your UI meets the expectations of Android users.

- Go through all of your extension's critical paths on an Android device to ensure they work as expected.

- Make sure the extension works well without an internet connection, as connectivity can be unreliable on mobile devices.

- Test your extension on a variety of device types and sizes. Android Studio's [virtual devices](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds) can help.

## Install and run your extension in Firefox for Android

::: note
These instructions are for temporarily loading an extension. Instructions for persistent loading of extensions in Firefox for Android Nightly or Beta can be found on [this blog post](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2020/09/29/expanded-extension-support-in-firefox-for-android-nightly/).
:::

In the unzipped directory of your extension, run `web-ext run -t firefox-android` and follow the instructions on screen to make sure you select the right device. Select `org.mozilla.fenix` as the apkname (or `org.mozilla.firefox_beta` for Firefox Beta for Android).

Here is an example of the command:

<!-- Syntax Highlighting -->

```shell
web-ext run -t firefox-android --adb-device XXX --firefox-apk org.mozilla.fenix
```

<!-- END: Syntax Highlighting -->

::: note
 The add-on will be loaded in the main browser profile instead of a new temporary profile directory.

## Debug your extension

::: note alert
Currently, you cannot inspect the markup of Fenix's browserAction popups using the Firefox Developer Tools Inspector (see [bug 1637616](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1637616)). As a workaround, we recommend that you temporarily change the extension to open the popup extension page into a tab to be able to inspect it.
:::

You can debug your extension in the web developer tools and view any `manifest.json` validation messages using `adb logcat`. To make use of these features, first set up Firefox remote debugging [over USB](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/about_colon_debugging/index.html#connecting-to-a-remote-device) or [via Wi-Fi](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/about_colon_debugging/index.html#connecting-to-android-over-wi-fi).

### Using web development tools to debug your extension

With your device connected over USB or Wi-Fi, open `about:debugging` and enable the device connection.

![Enable USB Devices](/assets/img/documentation/develop/enable-device-connection.png)

Your device is listed in the left-hand column, click **Connect**.

![Connect to device](/assets/img/documentation/develop/connect-to-device.png)

If prompted, allow the incoming connection on your Android device. Now start your extension on the Android device using `web-ext run`. You will need to have at least one tab opened in order for your extension to load. Click your device in the left-hand column and scroll down to find **Processes** in the list of active features in the browser.

![Locate processes](/assets/img/documentation/develop/locate-processes.png)

Click **Inspect** next to **Main Process**. The web developer toolbox displays in **Debugger**.

For much of the debugging work, it's useful to be able to view **Console** with **Inspector** or **Debugger**. You do this using the [split console](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/Web_Console/Split_console), press `esc` to activate this mode.

Load a page in which your extension exercises. Now you can access any of the JavaScript in your extension.

![Device debugging](/assets/img/documentation/develop/on-device-debugging.png)

::: note
Content scripts can be reached and debugged when connected to the main process or to a tab target where a content script is running.
:::

In the **Debugger** you can set breakpoints, step through code, modify the extension's state, and do [everything else you'd expect to be able to do in a debugger](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/Debugger). Any messages logged by your code display in **Console**.

To inspect the popup's HTML and CSS, use **Inspector**. First, click the page select icon (![Device debugging](/assets/img/documentation/develop/page-selector.png)) to open the HTML document you want to inspect. You can [review and modify the document's HTML and CSS in **Inspector**](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector), as you would with any webpage.

For more details on using the web developer tools, see [Firefox Developer Tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools).

### Viewing manifest validation messages using the console

In addition to the messages from your code, the console may also include messages about the validation of the extension's `manifest.json` files. These messages can be viewed using the adb logcat command. To avoid receiving other unrelated messages, you can pipe the output through grep, filtering by the extension's ID. For example:

```shell
/path/to/adb logcat | grep borderify@example.com
```

This will give output similar to this:

```shell
I/Gecko (30440): 1496056181889 addons.xpi WARN Addon with ID borderify@example.com already installed, older version will be disabled
```

If your add-on fails to run, check these messages as they may provide information explaining why.

## Manifest V3 compatibility

Firefox for Android doesn't have full feature parity with the desktop version of Firefox. There are several known issues with Firefox for Android that can lead to a poor user experience. Therefore, it's recommended you use Manifest V2 for extensions targeting Firefox for Android.

| Issue description | Tracking bug |
| --- | --- |
| Background service workers aren't supported on Firefox for Android. Instead, use [event pages](/documentation/develop/manifest-v3-migration-guide.md#event-pages-and-backward-compatibility). | [Bug&nbsp;1573659](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1573659) |
| Firefox for Android doesn't visually indicate when an extension has a pending `"host_permissions"` grant request for the user. | [Bug&nbsp;1820867](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1820867) |
| Users can't edit an extension's host permission grants in Add-ons Manager on Firefox for Android. | [Bug&nbsp;1812125](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1812125) |
