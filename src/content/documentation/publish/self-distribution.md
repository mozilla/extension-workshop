You aren't required to list or distribute your add-on through [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org) (AMO); you can distribute it yourself. However, before distributing your add-on yourself, here are some things you should consider:

- AMO is a very popular distribution platform with millions of monthly visitors and installations. It's integrated into the Firefox Add-ons Manager, allowing for easy installation of add-ons published on AMO.

- When an add-on is listed on AMO, Firefox automatically updates installed copies when a new version is listed on AMO. Firefox updates self-distributed add-ons like this:

  - If the extension includes an [`update_url`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/Updates) in its manifest, Firefox installs any updates with a higher version number available on that URL.
  - If it doesn't include an `update_url`, Firefox checks AMO for a listed update. If a listed update with a higher version number is available, Firefox distributes that version to users who have installed the self-distributed file.

  Otherwise, you need to distribute updates for your users to install.

For more information on how to submit an add-on for distribution on AMO or self-distribution, see [Submitting an add-on](/documentation/publish/submitting-an-add-on/).

## Self-distribution options

When you choose to distribute an add-on yourself, users can install them using these methods:

- [Web download](#web-download) in Firefox for desktop—make your extension available on a suitable web-accessible server. When a user downloads the signed add-on file, Firefox installs it. The web-accessible server must serve the signed add-on xpi file with `Content-Type: application/x-xpinstall` in the HTTP response headers.
  ::: note alert
  This method doesn't work in Firefox for Android. In this case, the add-on is downloaded, and the user needs to follow the instructions for [installing add-on from file](/documentation/publish/install-self-distributed#install-addon-from-file-android).
  :::

- [Installing add-on from file](/documentation/publish/install-self-distributed)—enables a user to install an add-on using an `.xpi` file saved on their computer or Android device.

- [Add-ons in an enterprise environment](/documentation/enterprise/enterprise-distribution/)—this page discusses the use of signed compared to unsigned extensions, installation options, the Firefox settings affecting installation, and including add-ons with a custom Firefox install package.

### Web download

When distributing an add–on from your website, you have two options for making the signed add–on file available for download:

- **Recommended approach:** from a link on a webpage, like this:
  ```html
  <div id="example-option-1" class="install-ok">
    <a href="https://example.com/path/to/extension.xpi">
      Install my add-on
    </a>
  </div>
  ```

- Using JavaScript, like this:
  ```html
  <div id="example-option-2" class="install-ok">
    <button>
      Install my add-on
    </button>
    <script>
      document.querySelector("#example-option-2 > button").onclick = () => {
        window.location = "https://example.com/path/to/extension.xpi";
      };
    </script>
  </div>
  ```
  If you take this approach, make sure that the browser detects your JavaScript code as handling user input. For example, it is called from inside a DOM click event.

If the download link or triggering JavaScript is not on the top-level frame of the website, none of the frames between the top-level page and the frame containing the download or JavaScript can be third-party or cross-origin frames.

::: note
You may find references to using the `InstallTrigger` API to trigger a download from JavaScript. This API is not supported and it will be removed (see [Bug 1776426](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1776426)). Its use is, therefore, not recommended.
:::

Using either method, Firefox installs the signed add-on file when the user downloads it.

See [submitting an add-on](/documentation/publish/submitting-an-add-on/#self-distribution) for details on how to download your signed add-on file.
