You aren't required to list or distribute your add-on through [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org) (AMO); you can distribute it yourself. However, before distributing your add-on yourself, here are some things you should consider:

- AMO is a very popular distribution platform, with millions of monthly visitors and installations. It's integrated into the Firefox Add-ons Manager, allowing for easy installation of add-ons published on AMO.
- When an add-on is listed on AMO, Firefox automatically updates installed copies when a new version is listed on AMO. To enable Firefox to automatically update self-distributed add-ons, the URL where Firefox can find updates needs to be included in the add-on manifest's [`update_url`](/documentation/manage/updating-your-extension/#enable-update) key.

For self-distributed add-ons that don't have an update URL, Firefox checks AMO for updates and the add-on is updated to a listed version, if one is available.

For more information on how to submit an add-on for distribution on AMO or self-distribution, see [Submitting an add-on](/documentation/publish/submitting-an-add-on/).

## Self-distribution options

When you choose to distribute an add-on yourself, they can be installed using the following methods:

- [Web download](/documentation/publish/submitting-an-add-on/#self-distribution)—make your extension available on a suitable web accessible server and when the user downloads the signed add-on file Firefox will install it.
- [Installing add-on from file](/documentation/publish/distribute-sideloading)—enables a user to install an add-on using an .xpi file saved on their computer.
- Add-ons for use with a desktop app—starting with Firefox 74, it is no longer be possible to have an extension be automatically installed as part of another application install. See the [Add-ons Blog](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2020/03/10/support-for-extension-sideloading-has-ended/) for more information.
- [Add-ons in an enterprise environment](/documentation/enterprise/enterprise-distribution/)—this page discusses the use of signed compared to unsigned extensions, installation options, the Firefox settings affecting installation, and including add-ons with a custom Firefox install package.
