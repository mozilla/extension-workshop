# Installing self-distributed extensions

You can make a self-distributed extension available as a [web download](/documentation/publish/self-distribution/#options) that is installed automatically into desktop Firefox. To install self-distributed extensions downloaded in Firefox for Android or distributed in another way, you need to provide instructions for installing the extension from a file.

::: note
If you use self-distribution for a beta version of a listed extension, Firefox doesn’t automatically update the beta version when you sign a new beta version on AMO. For more information on delivering beta updates, see [Distribute pre-release versions](/documentation/publish/distribute-pre-release-versions/).
:::

Automatic compatibility checks are performed for extensions installed from a file.

## Preparing your add-on

To prepare your add-on for installation from file:

1. Include an ID in the extension’s `manifest.json` file, replacing **_your-add-on-name@your-domain.com_** with a suitable ID for your add-on:

<!-- Syntax Highlighting -->
```json
"browser_specific_settings": {
  "gecko": {
    "id": "your-add-on-name@your-domain.com"
  }
}
```
<!-- END: Syntax Highlighting -->

An email address style ID is recommended.

2. Sign the add-on on [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org) (AMO). Depending on how you want to make your add-on available, you can use either the unlisted (if you are distributing the add-on exclusively) or listed options. For more details, see [Signing and distributing your add-on](/documentation/publish/signing-and-distribution-overview/).
