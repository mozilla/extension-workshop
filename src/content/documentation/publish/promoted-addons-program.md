In September 2020, we announced the pilot of a new Promoted Add-ons program. This program, which will be piloted between the end of September and the end of November 2020,  aims to expand the number of add-ons we can verify as safe, and provides developers with options for boosting their discoverability. For more information about the program and to sign-up for the waitlist, please see [this post](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2020/09/09/introducing-the-promoted-add-ons-pilot/) on the Add-ons Blog.

Participation in the Promoted Add-ons program is currently limited due to our capacity for manual add-on reviews and other restrictions, but we may expand in the future if interest in the program grows.
