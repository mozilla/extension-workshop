# Optimize Your Product Page

When you build an extension, you make the web better. To get your great idea out into the world, people need to find and use what you’ve created. Help them by creating a great product page on addons.mozilla.org. When you do, you may see improvements in **search engine results, usability, and installations**.

## To edit your product page:

- If you are creating a new extension or theme, you’ll need to create an account on [addons.mozilla.org/developers](https://addons.mozilla.org/developers/ 'addons.mozilla.org/developers/'), select **New Submission**, and submit your extension or theme file. Once you do this, you will create your Product Page within the submission flow.
- If you are updating an existing product page, you will log in to [addons.mozilla.org/developers](https://addons.mozilla.org/developers/ 'addons.mozilla.org/developers/') and select **Edit Information** to revise content.
- All fields can be updated at any time. You will need to update the following content types in both your manifest and on addons.mozilla.org:
  - Author Name,
  - Extension/Theme Name,
  - Subtitle,
  - Extension Icon,
