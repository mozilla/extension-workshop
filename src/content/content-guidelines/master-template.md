Your extension’s name is critical. It shows up everywhere—in search results, on [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org 'addons.mozilla.org'), and in the browser itself. It’s sometimes one of the few pieces of information that a user has to determine whether or not they are interested in what you built.

Research shows that people really do take an extension’s name into account when making installation decisions. And, what you put into the extension name field becomes your URL on [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org 'addons.mozilla.org').

Between your extension name and subtitle, you have up to 70 characters to use—that’s because 70 is the max character limit for your headline in external search results. It’s best to keep your extension name shorter so you have more characters left over for your subtitle.

- Tincidunt lobortis feugiat vivamus at augue eget arcu dictum. Enim facilisis gravida neque convallis a cras.
- Id diam vel quam elementum pulvinar etiam non. Quam id leo in vitae turpis.

## Extension Name Do’s and Don’ts

Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.

<!-- Do this -->
<section class="do-this"><header><h5>Do This</h5></header>

1. **Make it memorable**
2. **Make it unique**
3. **Keep it short for better display on smaller screens**
4. **Make it easy to read and say**
5. **Give an idea or hint about what your extension does with an illustrative word or metaphor**

<!-- Example (Block) -->
<div class="example">

Examples: An extension that saves passwords is called **Remembear**

An extension that puts a cat on new tabs is called **Tabbycat**

An extension that improves YouTube is called **Enhancer for YouTube**

</div>
<!-- END: Example (Block) -->
</section>
<!-- END: Do this -->

<!-- Not this -->
<section class="not-this"><header><h5>Not This</h5></header>

##### 1. Don't include a description.

Save these details for your subtitle and description.

<!-- Example (Inline) -->

<span class="example">Example: Videomix, a fast video downloader</span>

<!-- END: Example (Inline) -->

##### 2. Don't stuff it with keywords.

Google is smarter than this and it just makes your extension look untrustworthy.

<!-- Example (Inline) -->

<span class="example">Example: Youtube Download Videos, Convert, Media, MP3, MP4, Free.</span>

<!-- END: Example (Inline) -->

##### 3. Don't use random words to differentiate, like “Barbara Notetaker.”

Instead, create a descriptive name that is not already in use, like “Instant Notetaker.”

##### 4. Don't call it something with no meaning, like “hoyv.”

While the name “hoyv” doesn’t work, the name “uBlock Origin” for an ad-blocking extension does because it contains the word “block”.

##### 5. Don't include "WebExtension," “Firefox” or “Mozilla."

##### 6. Don't include version number or a previous name.

<!-- Example (Inline) -->

<span class="example">Example: Weatherchanger (fix version)</span>

<!-- END: Example (Inline) -->

##### 7. Don't make it hard to read or say.

<!-- Example (Inline) -->

<span class="example">Example: TrLrs! Tab Changer.</span>

<!-- END: Example (Inline) -->

##### Remembear Example:

## Stuck? Try this.

#### 1. Identify the problem

What problem does your extension solve? You had a reason for creating that extension...what was it? Write that down.

Take the popular extension, Remembear, as an example. You can imagine the creator of this extension writing, "I am tired of having to remember all of my passwords for the web. And I worry that these passwords will get stolen. I want a simple way to save and secure my passwords so they are always at my fingertips. And I don’t want the experience to be an unpleasant, security-laden process. Let’s make it friendly and easy.

#### 2. Identify key words

Pull out the key words (nouns, adjectives, verbs) and phrases from your description and create a word list. Add other words that come to mind based on those words, including synonyms.

Remembear Example:

- Tired
- Remember
- Passwords
- Worry
- Stolen
- Simple
- Save
- Secure
- At your fingertips
- Friendly
- Easy

#### 3. Example Lorum Ipsum

Pull out the key words (nouns, adjectives, verbs) and phrases from your description and create a word list. Add other words that come to mind based on those words, including synonyms.

Remembear: dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur lemera dosada peel.
